# Active Context

This document captures the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions in the Dapper Cluster project. It serves as the most up-to-date representation of the project's current state and priorities.

## Current Work Focus

The Dapper Cluster is a functioning GitOps-managed Kubernetes homelab environment running production-grade applications and services. The project is currently focused on:

1. **Documentation and Observability**: Establishing comprehensive documentation (including this Memory Bank) to track system knowledge and facilitate easier maintenance and troubleshooting.

2. **Security Hardening**: Continuously improving security practices, particularly around authentication, network policies, and vulnerability management.

3. **Application Management**: Maintaining and upgrading the deployed applications with a focus on reliability and security.

4. **Automation Improvements**: Enhancing automation capabilities to reduce manual interventions and improve system resilience.

## Recent Changes

Recent significant changes to the system include:

1. **Memory Bank Creation**: Established a structured documentation system (Memory Bank) to maintain project knowledge and context.

2. **Repository Organization**: The repository is organized into a structured hierarchy with applications grouped by function (observability, media, home-automation, etc.).

3. **Application Deployments**: Various applications have been deployed and are being managed through the GitOps workflow, including:
   - Core infrastructure components (cert-manager, external-secrets, etc.)
   - Home automation services (Home Assistant, ESPHome, etc.)
   - Media services (Plex, Sonarr, Radarr, etc.)
   - Productivity applications (Actual, Paperless-ngx, etc.)
   - AI tools (Ollama, Open WebUI, etc.)

4. **Monitoring Implementations**: Comprehensive monitoring with kube-prometheus-stack, Grafana, Loki, and status page integrations.

## Next Steps

Planned next steps for the project include:

1. **Enhance Backup Strategy**: Further develop the backup and recovery strategy for critical data and configurations.

2. **Optimize Resource Usage**: Review and optimize resource allocation across the cluster to improve efficiency.

3. **Implement Network Policies**: Develop more granular network policies to enforce least-privilege communication between services.

4. **Dashboard Improvements**: Create additional Grafana dashboards for improved visibility into system and application metrics.

5. **Documentation Expansion**: Continue to expand documentation on operational procedures, troubleshooting guides, and system architecture.

6. **Disaster Recovery Testing**: Regularly test backup and recovery procedures to ensure they function as expected.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

Current decisions and considerations that are being actively evaluated:

1. **Security vs. Convenience**: Balancing strong security measures with ease of use, particularly for frequently accessed services.

2. **Resource Allocation**: Determining appropriate resource requests and limits for applications to ensure efficient resource usage without compromising performance.

3. **Update Cadence**: Establishing appropriate schedules for updating different components (Talos, Kubernetes, applications) to balance security, stability, and feature improvements.

4. **Storage Solutions**: Evaluating the current storage architecture and considering improvements for both performance and resilience.

5. **Credential Management**: Reviewing and refining the approach to managing and rotating credentials across the system.

6. **Cloud Dependencies**: Continuously evaluating which services are appropriate to maintain in the cloud versus self-hosting, considering the "hit by a bus factor" for critical services.

## Current System Status

The current system status is:

- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Operational with 7 Talos nodes running on virtualized infrastructure
- **Core Services**: All core services (networking, storage, security) are deployed and functioning
- **Application Services**: Production applications are deployed across various namespaces
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting is in place
- **Security**: Key security measures are implemented, with ongoing improvements

This document will be regularly updated to reflect the current state of the project, ensuring that the most relevant information is always available for decision-making and operations.
