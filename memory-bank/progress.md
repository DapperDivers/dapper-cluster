# Progress

This document tracks the current state of the Dapper Cluster project, including what works, what's still in progress, and known issues.

## What Works

### Core Infrastructure

- ✅ **Kubernetes Cluster**: 7 Talos VMs deployed and operational
- ✅ **Storage**: OpenEBS Mayastor providing high-performance block storage
- ✅ **Networking**: Cilium CNI for pod networking, External-DNS for DNS management
- ✅ **Security**: cert-manager for certificates, External Secrets for secrets management, Authentik for authentication
- ✅ **GitOps**: Flux controllers monitoring Git repository and reconciling state
- ✅ **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki stack deployed and monitoring the cluster

### Application Categories

- ✅ **Home Automation**: Home Assistant, ESPHome, Node-RED, Zigbee2MQTT
- ✅ **Media Services**: Plex, Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, other media management tools
- ✅ **Productivity**: Paperless-ngx, Actual, other personal tools
- ✅ **Security Services**: Authentik, Vaultwarden
- ✅ **AI Tools**: Ollama, Open WebUI, Wyoming Whisper
- ✅ **Databases**: PostgreSQL via CloudNative PG, Redis, EMQX

### DevOps Features

- ✅ **Automated Dependency Updates**: Renovate monitoring and updating dependencies
- ✅ **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows for validation
- ✅ **Secrets Management**: SOPS for encrypted secrets in Git
- ✅ **Policy Enforcement**: Kyverno policies implemented
- ✅ **Documentation**: Basic documentation in place in docs/ directory

## In Progress

### Infrastructure Enhancements

- 🔄 **Backup Strategy**: VolSync configured but needs more comprehensive coverage
- 🔄 **Network Policies**: Basic policies in place, but more granular policies needed
- 🔄 **Resource Optimization**: Ongoing tuning of resource requests and limits

### Development & Operations

- 🔄 **Documentation**: Expanding operational documentation and troubleshooting guides
- 🔄 **Monitoring Dashboards**: Creating more comprehensive dashboards for specific applications
- 🔄 **Alerting Rules**: Refining alerting thresholds and notifications

### Applications

- 🔄 **AI Enhancements**: Expanding AI capabilities with more models and integrations
- 🔄 **Home Automation Integrations**: Extending Home Assistant with more automations and integrations
- 🔄 **Media Management Refinement**: Optimizing media workflows and organization

## What's Left to Build

### Infrastructure

- 📝 **Disaster Recovery Testing**: Formalized process for testing recovery procedures
- 📝 **High Availability Improvements**: Enhanced resilience for critical services
- 📝 **Advanced Network Segmentation**: More sophisticated network policies and segmentation

### Applications

- 📝 **Additional Self-hosted Services**: New productivity and utility services to reduce external dependencies
- 📝 **Enhanced Integrations**: Deeper integration between deployed applications
- 📝 **User Experience Enhancements**: Improved interfaces and workflows for frequently used services

### Operations

- 📝 **Automated Testing**: More comprehensive testing of services and infrastructure
- 📝 **Documentation Platform**: Enhanced documentation system with better organization
- 📝 **Compliance Framework**: Structured approach to security and compliance validation

## Current Status

The cluster is **operational and stable**, running production workloads for home automation, media services, personal productivity, and other categories. Core infrastructure components are functioning reliably, with ongoing improvements to security, monitoring, and automation.

Current focus areas are:
1. Enhancing documentation (including this Memory Bank)
2. Strengthening backup and recovery capabilities
3. Optimizing resource usage and performance
4. Refining security practices

## Known Issues

| Issue | Description | Priority | Status |
|-------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Resource Pressure | Some nodes experience periodic resource pressure during intensive operations | Medium | Monitoring and optimizing |
| Update Coordination | Occasional dependency conflicts during automated updates | Medium | Implementing better constraints |
| Backup Validation | Need more systematic validation of backup integrity | High | Planning implementation |
| Documentation Gaps | Some operational procedures lack detailed documentation | Medium | Actively addressing |
| Alert Noise | Some monitoring alerts create occasional false positives | Low | Tuning thresholds |

This document will be updated regularly to reflect the current state of progress and to highlight areas that need attention or improvement.
